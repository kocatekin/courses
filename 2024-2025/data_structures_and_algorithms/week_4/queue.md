# Queue


QUEUE -> FIFO (First in First Out)

Later, we are going to use Queue (like Stack) for tree traversal. However now, we are just learning how to use it. 
If you remember, we gave the example of a *ticket booth*. A *waiting line* is a good example for a queue. Whoever gets in the line first, gets the ticket first!

Stacks and queues are also referred to as ADT (Abstract Data Types). We talked about these in depth in the class. Stacks and queues are ADT because there are multiple ways to implement them. When we implement them, they become the *data structure*. Here, for the beginning we are implementing them by using arrays. However, this is not fully correct and our implementation is not perfect. Later, we are going to implement them again using lists. Stacks and queues are generally *dynamic* unlike arrays, which are static. Of course, we can control the capacity.

In addition, these *data structures* or *abstract data types* are already in the programming language. Most of the languages have this, except C. Therefore, you can easily check the implementation and interface of these in the programming language we use, Java. There, you would see that the *queue* and *stack* are **interfaces** and we can choose the implementation method: *arraylist* and *linkedlist*.
