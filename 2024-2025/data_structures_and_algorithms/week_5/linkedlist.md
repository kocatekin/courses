# LinkedList

It is a **dynamic** data structure. It means that you can change the size, etc but the data in the memory is **non-contiguous**. 

There are several LinkedLists:
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

Like ArrayList, LinkedList also implements the List interface. Therefore, the user can *add* items, *remove* items and *update* them. However, the implementation of LinkedList is much different than ArrayList. Remember that in the ArrayList, we were using static arrays. Here, we are not doing it.

Linked list is a data structure consisting of a collection of **nodes**, which together represent a sequence. A node stores *data* and a *reference* (or link) to the next node in the sequence. (In C, C++; it stores the *address* of the next node)

All nodes are serially linked. 


In order to reach a node, you need to go through each node previous to it.
