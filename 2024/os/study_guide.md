# Study guide for the finals

Here is a detailed guide to help you for the final exam. I do not expect you to memorize every slide. However, you should have an understanding of general concepts. I am not going to ask any questions from the midterm. You are only responsible from the things we've done after it. 

Although I give some tips, questions can be related to how well you understood the concepts. For example, you should know what fragmentation is. You should know what *paging* is. If you do, then you can easily answer the question: "How does paging avoid external fragmentation?" This should be your focus in all courses and all tests.



## Bash

There will be some easy, one line questions about bash. If you attended and tried the commands on your own, you won't have a problem. It will be 10 points.

## Memory management and Virtual Memory Management

First, you need to understand how things work. CPU can communicate with main memory, not secondary memory. But sometimes, we need more memory than we have so we use the secondary memory. 

* What is swapping?
* What is paging? Page tables, page faults, etc. 
* What are frames, pages? Virtual memory and physical memory?
* What is fragmentation? Internal and external.
* You should be able to fill logical memory, physical memory by using the page table and vice versa.

* What is demand paging?
* There are page replacement algorithms? Why do we need them?
* What are those page replacement algorithms? From page 21, we talk about reference string and page replacement algorithms. You should understand how the example works in page 25, 28. 

So, know what the *reference string* is. If I give you empty page frames, you should be able to fill in those based on the reference string and the page replacement algorithm I give you.


## CPU Scheduling

We talked about how to schedule processes. There are some algorithms to help us in this regard. Starting from page 14, we see some algorithms. You should know how they work and you should be able to draw Gantt charts of these scheduling algorithms.

## Final comments

I do not ask any questions I did not solve in the classroom. Those who attended and took an interest will not have any problems. I do not recommend you to leave the course for the make up exam. The questions are very straight forward in the final, and we actually solved them all. If you understood them, you will not have any problems.

Good luck.
