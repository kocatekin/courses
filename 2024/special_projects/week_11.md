# Notes for Week 11


In the course I asked you to implement the following problems as functions.

* A function called compress. For example there is a given input "aaabbaa", the function will output "a3b2a2"

You can find the code in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kocatekin/js_programs/main/compress.js

* A function called **titleCase**. This gets a string as an input. String can be a sentence too. The output should give every word in the form of *Word*. So, every word will start with a capital letter.

Code in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kocatekin/js_programs/main/titleCase.js

* A function called **to_sentence**. It gets an array as an input. Returns a string in the form of "element1, element2, and element3".

Code in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kocatekin/js_programs/main/to_sentence.js


Please work on these functions and try to write them by yourself.
