# Exercises


* Create a function (randint) which gets two arguments and provides an integer between those numbers.

* Create a function (advancedUniform) which gets three arguments a, b and c and provides a random integer between a and b, which is a multiple of c.

* Create a function (randomChoice) which gets an array as an argument and returns a random selection of that argument.

* Create a function (randomChoices) which gets two arguments, array and an integer (b); returns b random selection from the input array.

* If you finished all above, try to implement a queue by using an array. You can use object oriented programming or you can just create two functions enqueue(int x) and dequeue(), which adds to tail and removes from head respectively. Doing this as OOP would be better, but it is not mandatory.
