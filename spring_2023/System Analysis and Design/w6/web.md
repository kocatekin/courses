# Front-end

We have a _client_ and a _server_. The client is the **browser**, and the server is the **webserver**.
- The client can also be an application too!

Client sends _requests_ and the server gives back _responses_.
- The part on the browser is called **front-end**.
  - That is what the user _sees_.
