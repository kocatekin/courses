# Introduction

When you go to a restaurant, you don't go to the chef and order whatever you want.
- You use the menu.
- Things you can order can only be from the menu.
- That is an API
  - If you try to order something which is not on the menu, you will get an **error**.

# API

API gives information about the software.
- It is also good for securing data.
- You control what you want to expose!

You are not going to expose your whole database. You will control what you let others to see. That way you will keep your data secure. People can only change what they are _let_.

# API

There are two types of APIs. 
- Web API
- Library API
  
An API is generally a functionality we expose for a user to use when they are using our system (module, library or web app).

Web APIs are usually REST APIs.

# API

They use _tokens_ to identify who you are. 
- That way they can give you certain permissions on the data.

There are a lot of APIs, private and public.
- Some of them you can use without using any tokens.
